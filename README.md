# A Scalable Parallel Implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier
## General
This repository contains my deliverable artifact for the Year 3 Modular Undergraduate Course CCE3013 (Computer Architecture) at the University of Malta. The deliverable involves implementing a Serial algorithm in C++, which is later to be parallalized using the Nividia CUDA SDK.

## The Problem
The problem addressed by this artifact is that of Classification using a Decision tree.

Work State: Work In Progress.
